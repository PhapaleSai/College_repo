# 🧑‍💻 Practical 1: Creating a Git Repository and Pushing to GitHub

## 🧠 What I Learned

Today, I learned how to:

1. Create a brand new Git repository on my computer.
2. Connect it to a GitHub repository.
3. Add files, commit changes, and push them to GitHub.
4. Understand the purpose of each Git command in this process.

---

## ✅ Steps I Followed

### 🚀 1. Initialize a New Git Repository

```bash
git init
```

📁 This tells Git:

> “Hey! I want to start tracking changes in this folder now.”

A hidden `.git` folder is created. This is how Git keeps track of everything.

---

### 🔗 2. Add Remote Repository (GitHub Link)

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

💡 Replace `your-username` and `your-repo` with your actual GitHub username and repo name.

This tells Git:

> “This is where I want to send my work — to this GitHub repo.”

---

### ✅ 3. Check if Remote Was Added Correctly

```bash
git remote -v
```

This shows the remote URL (GitHub link) for **fetching** and **pushing** data.
You should see something like:

```
origin  https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git (push)
```

---

### 🗃️ 4. Add All Files to the Staging Area

```bash
git add .
```

This tells Git:

> “Hey, please include all these files for the next commit.”

🧠 The `.` means **add everything** in the current folder.

---

### 🔍 5. Check Git Status

```bash
git status
```

This shows:

* Which branch you are on
* What files are staged or not staged
* What’s ready to commit

💡 I use this to make sure everything looks good before committing.

---

### 💾 6. Commit the Changes with a Message

```bash
git commit -m "I have made some changes in demo.txt"
```

This tells Git:

> “Save a snapshot of the current changes. Here’s my message explaining what I did.”

📝 Always write **clear messages** so you remember what each commit was for.

---

### 📤 7. Push Changes to GitHub (main branch)

```bash
git push origin main
```

This tells Git:

> “Send my changes from my local machine to GitHub, to the `main` branch.”

If this is your first time pushing to a new repo, you might need:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

💡 The `-u` sets up a link so next time you can just run `git push`.

---

## 💡 Tips for Future Me

* Always `git init` only **once** in a folder.
* `git remote add origin` only if remote is not added yet.
* Run `git status` often to see what’s going on.
* Use meaningful commit messages — they help you understand your past work.
* If `main` branch doesn't exist, create it or rename from `master` using:

```bash
git branch -M main
```

# 🧑‍💻 Practical 2: Cloning, Branching, Pushing, and Pull Requests on GitHub

## 🧠 What I Learned

Today, I learned how to:

1. **Clone a GitHub repository** to my computer.
2. **Make changes** to files.
3. **Create a new branch** to work separately.
4. **Push changes** to GitHub from a new branch.
5. **Collaborate** using **Pull Requests** on GitHub.
6. **Sync changes** from GitHub to my computer.
7. **Clear old login information** using Credential Manager.

---

## 🔧 Steps I Did in Order

### ✅ 1. Cloned the Repository from GitHub

This brings the GitHub project from the internet to my computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PhapaleSai/College_repo.git
```

👉 Now a folder named `College_repo` is on my computer.

---

### ✅ 2. Checked What's Inside

```bash
ls
cd College_repo/
ls
```

📁 This shows me all the files inside the project.

---

### ✅ 3. Created or Edited a File

I made or updated a file called `sai.txt` using the `vim` editor.

```bash
vim sai.txt
```

👉 Press `i` to **insert text**, type what you want, then:

* Press `Esc`
* Type `:wq`
* Press `Enter` to **save and quit**

* or use
* echo "hello i am sai " > your.txt file

---

### ✅ 4. Checked Git Status

This shows what files I changed or added.

```bash
git status
```

---

### ✅ 5. Committed My Changes

But wait! First, I **forgot to add** the file to the staging area. 😅
So I fixed that:

```bash
git add sai.txt
```

Then I saved my work with a message:

```bash
git commit -m "Added some content to sai.txt"
```

📝 This creates a snapshot of my changes.

---

### ✅ 6. Created a New Branch

I wanted to work on a separate line called `feature`.

```bash
git branch feature
git checkout feature
```

🔄 Now I'm working in the **feature** branch.

---

### ✅ 7. Added Remote Link (If not already added)

Just to make sure Git knows where my GitHub repo is:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/PhapaleSai/College_repo.git
git remote -v
```

This shows the link to GitHub is working. 👍

---

### ✅ 8. Pushed My Changes to GitHub

I sent my changes from my local `feature` branch to GitHub.

```bash
git push origin feature
```

🚀 Now my changes are on GitHub, under the `feature` branch.

---

### ✅ 9. Created a Pull Request (on GitHub)

Now it's time to **ask** GitHub to bring my `feature` changes into the main project.

🖱️ Go to: [https://github.com/PhapaleSai/College\_repo](https://github.com/PhapaleSai/College_repo)

Then:

1. Click the **"Compare & Pull Request"** button near the `feature` branch.
2. Write a small **title and description** (e.g., "Added content to sai.txt").
3. Click **"Create Pull Request"**.
4. If you're ready to bring the changes into `main`, click **"Merge Pull Request"**.
5. Click **"Confirm Merge"**.

🎉 Done! Your changes are now part of `main`.

---

### ✅ 10. Sync Changes from GitHub to My Computer

First, switch back to the `main` branch on your local machine:

```bash
git checkout main
```

Then get the latest changes from GitHub:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

🌐 This updates your local `main` branch with everything from GitHub.

---

### ✅ 11. Important Note: Credential Manager

If someone else was logged in before, you might see their GitHub login.

To fix this:

1. Go to **Windows Search** > type `Credential Manager`.
2. Open it.
3. Go to **Windows Credentials**.
4. Find anything that says `git:https://github.com` and **remove it**.
5. Next time you push or pull, Git will ask for **your GitHub login**.

🔐 This keeps your GitHub account safe and correct.

---

## 📌 Summary of Commands Used

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
ls
cd College_repo/
vim sai.txt
git status
git add sai.txt
git commit -m "Added some content to sai.txt"
git branch feature
git checkout feature
git remote add origin <repo-url>
git remote -v
git push origin feature
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

---

## 💡 Tips for Future Me

* Always make a **new branch** for new features or edits.
* Use **`git status`** often to check what’s happening.
* If login is wrong, fix it in **Credential Manager**.
* Don’t forget to **add** files before committing!
* Use **Pull Requests** to share and merge changes on GitHub.
